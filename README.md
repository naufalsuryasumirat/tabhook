# tabhook

Simple firefox extension to show tab numbers and options to quickly navigate between tabs (for linux), localized to each firefox window

## inspiration

This plugin takes inspration mainly from:

1. Tab Numbering (https://github.com/tuomassalo/tab-numbering)

Personally was using Tab Numbering, but stopped when it didn't work so well with Simple Tab Group

Also, was really frustrated that Ctrl+Number doesn't work in Linux with no option to change the modifier

## known issues

- Doesn't work with New Tab tabs

- If an inaccessible tab is closed/created the extension will not work correctly, so good luck
